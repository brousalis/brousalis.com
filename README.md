Codename: Obtvse
================
I wrote this engine entirely to share, without the intention of closing it off to other people.  Realizing how much it can improve the way you write, I've decided it should be open to everyone.  The goal is simple: when you see an Obtvse-powered website, you *know* the author has impeccible taste in free-software.  Obtvse bloggers are encouraged to share their work for the greater good of the community.

Check it out.
