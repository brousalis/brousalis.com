    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by <a href="http://usesthis.com/">The Setup</a>, a website filled with interviews dedicated to finding out how prominent designers and developers use to get their work done. My career has only just begun, but I thought I'd share what I use.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">15" MacBook Pro</a> has been my trusty companion for the last few years of my life. The flexibility and efficiency the Mac has gave me helped me succeed through 4 years at a tough engineering school. During school, I was surprised to see near 80% of the professors in the software engineering department use Macs, and would have not taken the job if they weren't allowed to. Now I can see why.</p>

<p>At home and work I operate on a <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">27" iMac</a>. The resolution, sharpness and colours from this display are the best I've ever seen, and doing my daily work on them now is an enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>All my input devices are wireless. I prefer wireless for minimizing clutter on my desktop.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>I switched to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> in 2009 after using Windows XP and <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">various</a> <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">flavours</a> of <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Linux</a>. The Mac community for developing in iOS is partially why I chose to switch permanently, especially after seeing my professors rant and rave about the operating system. I've never looked back.</p>

<p>All of the blogging and developing I do happens primarily in <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>. When I'm feeling frisky, I'll give ol' <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/">Xcode</a> a run, and create some memory errors. I use <a href="http://iterm.com">iTerm</a> with zsh and some heavily modified <a href="http://github.com/dpick/">scripts</a> for absolutely everything. I use <a href="http://reeder.com">Reeder</a> for my daily RSS feeds, and use <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> for all of my busy work. Naturally, <a href="http://adobe.com">Photoshop CS5</a> is used on a daily basis for any and all of my artistic needs.</p>

<p>This site is run on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static-site generator, turning markdown posts into what you see right now, using Sinatra/Ruby. I use <a href="http://typekit.com">TypeKit</a> for all of the fonts, and the one you are most likely seeing is <em>Proxima Nova</em>. The site was built around the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5Boilerplate</a>, using <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> and some custom scripts.</p>
