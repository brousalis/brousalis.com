Inspired by [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/), a website filled with interviews dedicated to finding out how prominent designers and developers use to get their work done. My career has only just begun, but I thought I'd share what I use.

### Hardware

The [15" MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/) has been my trusty companion for the last few years of my life. The flexibility and efficiency the Mac has gave me helped me succeed through 4 years at a tough engineering school. During school, I was surprised to see near 80% of the professors in the software engineering department use Macs, and would have not taken the job if they weren't allowed to. Now I can see why.

At home and work I operate on a [27" iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac/). The resolution, sharpness and colours from this display are the best I've ever seen, and doing my daily work on them now is an enjoyable experience.

All my input devices are wireless. I prefer wireless for minimizing clutter on my desktop. 

### Software

I switched to [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) in 2009 after using Windows XP and [various](http://www.gentoo.org/) [flavours](http://www.ubuntu.com/) of [Linux](http://www.debian.org/). The Mac community for developing in iOS is partially why I chose to switch permanently, especially after seeing my professors rant and rave about the operating system. I've never looked back.

All of the blogging and developing I do happens primarily in [TextMate](http://macromates.com/). When I'm feeling frisky, I'll give ol' [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/) a run, and create some memory errors. I use [iTerm](http://iterm.com) with zsh and some heavily modified [scripts](http://github.com/dpick/) for absolutely everything. I use [Reeder](http://reeder.com) for my daily RSS feeds, and use [Gmail](http://gmail.com) for all of my busy work. Naturally, [Photoshop CS5](http://adobe.com) is used on a daily basis for any and all of my artistic needs.

This site is run on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static-site generator, turning markdown posts into what you see right now, using Sinatra/Ruby. I use [TypeKit](http://typekit.com) for all of the fonts, and the one you are most likely seeing is _Proxima Nova_. The site was built around the [HTML5Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com), using [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and some custom scripts.
