I have spent about a year slowly configuring and adding to my personal set of dotfiles. I've hosted them to share with everyone on <a href="http://github.com/brousalis/dotfiles">Github</a>. I have some pretty handy tricks I've picked up in my obsession with my dev environment, and I'd like to share a few.

##Using Dropbox
<a class="dropbox" href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>I have a laptop for work, my iMac at home, several development machines hosted on Xen slices, and several virtual machines I use for testing. These machines are composed of Mac and Debian operating systems. To keep maintance of my config files easier between these environments, I have the Github repo cloned inside of my ~/Dropbox folder.  By doing this, each time you make a chance it is automatically updated on each environment. 

##Setting up your files
{% codeblock bootstrap.sh lang:bash https://github.com/brousalis/dotfiles/blob/master/bootstrap.sh github %}
#!/bin/bash

FOLDER="$HOME"/dotfiles

# install vim
if [ "$1" == "vim" ]
then
  source vim.sh    
  echo "Setup vim install"
fi

# dotfiles
cd      "$FOLDER"
ln -sf  "$FOLDER"/vimrc         "$HOME"/.vimrc
ln -sf  "$FOLDER"/bashrc        "$HOME"/.bashrc
ln -sf  "$FOLDER"/bash_profile  "$HOME"/.bash_profile
ln -sf  "$FOLDER"/vim           "$HOME"/.vim
ln -sf  "$FOLDER"/screenrc      "$HOME"/.screenrc
ln -sf  "$FOLDER"/tmuxconf      "$HOME"/.tmux.conf
ln -sf  "$FOLDER"/gitconfig     "$HOME"/.gitconfig
echo    "Setup symlinks"

# vim
mkdir -p "$HOME"/.vimbackup
mkdir -p "$HOME"/.vimtmp
echo "Setup vim temp"
{% endcodeblock %}

By running this file <span class="bash">./bootstrap</span> it sets up symlinks between the home folder and the dotfiles folder. This puts them in their correct place and also makes modifying these files much easier.

##Aliases
There are some handy aliases in my bashrc file, particularly these:

{% codeblock bashrc lang:bash https://github.com/brousalis/dotfiles/blob/master/bashrc github %}
function bugscreen() { export BUG=$1; screen -R $1; }
function u() { NUM=${1:-1}; for (( start = 1; start <= $NUM; start++ )); do cd ..; done; }
alias gitrem="git ls-files --deleted | xargs git rm"
alias dsremove="find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm --ignore-unmatch"
{% endcodeblock %}

<span class="bash">bugscreen 123456</span> loads a preconfigured screen session from the /screens/ folder. Read below to find out more.

<span class="bash">u 3</span> goes up 3 directories from where you are.

<span class="bash">gitrem</span> removes files you may have forgot to git rm in a folder

<span class="bash">dsremove</span> deletes all .DS_Store files from a directory


##Preconfigured screens
Located in the /screen/ folder, is an example of how to setup a screen sessionwith preconfigured tabs. Then in my .screenrc
