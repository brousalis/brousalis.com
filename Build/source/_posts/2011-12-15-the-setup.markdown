Inspired by [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/), a website filled with interviews dedicated to finding out how and what designers and developers use to get their work done. My career has only just begun, but I thought I'd share what I use.

### Hardware

The [15" MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/) has been my dev machine for the last few years of my life. Upgrading to an SSD drive will change your life, if you haven't had the opportunity. As lame as it is, I splurged for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054JGGGY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=sebadewithsbl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0054JGGGY">Razer Mamba</a> mouse. You can turn off the glowing LED lights on this version, and it proves a really accurate and light weight mouse. 

At home, I connect my laptop to a [27" iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac/). The resolution, sharpness and colours from this display are the best I've ever seen, and using any other monitor is depressing.

### Software

I switched to [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) in 2009 after using Windows XP and [various](http://www.ubuntu.com/) [flavours](http://www.gentoo.org/) of [Linux](http://www.debian.org/). I do miss [Awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/) window manager, as I prefer never to use my mouse, but by using some special keybindings and apps I can emulate it well enough on Lion.

All of my developing and editing is done in [VIM](http://vim.org). The learning curve is very high, but once you've got the hang of it - there's no looking back. I use [iTerm](http://iterm2.com) with zsh and some heavily modified [dotfiles](http://github.com/brousalis/dotfiles) for absolutely everything. I use [Reeder](http://reeder.com) for my daily RSS feeds, and use [Gmail](http://gmail.com) for all of my busy work. For mocking and design, I use [Photoshop CS6](http://adobe.com), shockingly.

This site is run on [Octopress](http://octopress.org), a static-site generator, turning markdown posts into what you see right now. I use [TypeKit](http://typekit.com) for all of the fonts, and the one you are most likely seeing is _Proxima Nova_ (sans) and _Adele_ (serif).
