<h2>About</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tatejohnson/5332661190/"><img id="left" src="{{ base.url }}/images/me.jpg" alt="Tate Johnson" /></a> I am a 24 year old software developer living in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23054854@N06/3319265306/in/set-72157614423917229/">Brisbane, Australia</a>. You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/tatejohnson/">Twitter</a>, browse my photos on <a href="http://flickr.com/tatejohnson/">Flickr</a>, hear what I listen to on <a href="http://last.fm/user/Tatey/">Last.fm</a> or check out my code on <a href="http://github.com/tatey">GitHub</a>. My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:tate@tatey.com">tate@tatey.com</a>.</p>

<p>My love of computers started when the old man showed me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)">Prince of Persia</a> on a 386. I bounced from a gamer interested in PC hardware, to a Linux fanatic who would install a <a href="http://archlinux.org">distribution</a> on anything with 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s before developing a genuine passion for software. Since February 2008 I have been employed as a software developer for <a href="http://everydayhero.com.au">Everyday Hero</a>, a service for empowering not for profits with the tools to create richer giving experiences. In December 2010 I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tatejohnson/5285063354/">graduated</a> with a Bachelor of Information Technology from <a href="http://griffith.edu.au">Griffith University</a>. I have also <a href="{{ base.url }}/2011/04/16/the-setup/">written</a> about what hardware and software I use.</p>

<h2>This Site</h2>

<p>I purchased tatey.com in 2003 and kicked it off with MovableType. Since then it's bounced between WordPress, Ruby on Rails and Jekyll. Today, it is automatically generated by <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master">Jekyll</a> into a static site. Posts are in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and the source resides on <a href="http://github.com/tatey/tatey.com/tree/master">GitHub</a>, never to be lost again! Site is marked up with HTML5 and styled with CSS3. All pages ought to be valid and semantic. If you find an error, <a href="mailto:tate@tatey.com">please let me know</a>.</p>
